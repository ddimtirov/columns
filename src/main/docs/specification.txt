RAW-ITEMS are a set of uniform tupples (could be derived from beans or maps).

ITEM-GROUPS are a list of sets of raw items,
    derived by a GROUPING STRATEGY and
    ordered by a SORTING STRATEGY that can be controlled by user.

SELECTION is a subset of the group-list, specified by USER GESTURES.
Selection is usually flattened and used to derive a descendent slice.

SELECTION-PIN is a strategy for maintaining the selection when the raw-data changes.
Pins can maintain the selection
    by index (first-N or last-N),
    by sorted position index (first/last-N after sorting with certain comparator),
    by value (positive and negative filtering),
    composite (this and that, but not that) or
    unpinned (raw-data changes nuke the selection).

SLICE-TREE visualizes SLICE-BRANCHES graph in a columnar layout and serves as BRANCH factory.
Slice tree might have defaults strategy, determining the grouper, sorter and pinning for a new slice. 

SLICE-VIEW visualizes the whole item-groups list of a BRANCH, usualy using a JList or JTable widget.

SLICE-RENDERER renders a single item-group, possibly via JLabel or
    drawing directly on a JComponent canvas.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each column can also be split in a SLICE-BRANCH to explore different selections.
By default there is only a single branch.
All branches share the same raw-data, but the selection output is independent.

Each branch can be split in multiple SLICE-PROJECTIONS to explore the same dataset
    using different groupers, sorters and presenters.
All projections have simple selection-pin strategy and their outputs are merged
    using a composite-selection-pin.
